        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Please go through these things carefully. *Terms and conditions applied*.</p>
    </header>

    <div>
        <p>1. Don't ask me for money cause I myself don't have any.</p>
        <p>2. You will not use "What do you call?" jokes.</p>
        <p>3. I'm not your enemy, so you have no reason to roast me.</p>
        <p>4. If I hurt you emotionally, don't take it personally cause I don't know what deeds I sometimes commit,
            which I repent.</p>
        <p>5. Don't find any mistakes (grammatical or spelling) in this document.</p>
        <p>6. You shouldn't make weird instincts on me, but even if you make, delete them from your mind.</p>
        <p>7. Don't keep on using the same words every time and if possible, you should rather use simple words.</p>
        <p>8. Just don't add too many swear words.</p>
        <p>9. I don't hate you.</p>
        <p>10. Just don't promote any products or show me ads to me.</p>
        <p>11. If I deny you somehow, don't be dejected.</p>
        <p>12. If you encroach on my box, the consequences are nothing or very severe.</p>
        <p>13. Just don't flex your knowledge unnecessarily, unless it's some kind of a battle.</p>
        <p>14. You shouldn't ping me for getting a job in the Failure Management Corporation.</p>
        <p>15. My business is private and am not going to give its shares to anyone even though you want to invest in
            it.</p>
    </div>

    <footer>
        <p>I can't find any more conditions but I'll add more if I find some. Also NOTE: "Since you read this document
            fully, or even just went through it, it means that you've signed a plane sheet of paper in which I can add
            whatever conditions I want in the future."</p>
